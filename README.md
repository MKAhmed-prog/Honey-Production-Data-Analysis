# Honey-Production-Data-Analysis
Data Visualization on Honey Production dataset using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

# Objective:
The Goal is to use Python visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib to investigate the data and get
some useful conclusions.

1. Import required libraries and read the dataset.
2. Check the first few samples, shape, info of the data and try to familiarize yourself with different features.
3. Display the percentage distribution of the data in each year using the pie chart.
4. Plot and Understand the distribution of the variable "price per lb" using displot, and write your findings.
5. Plot and understand the relationship between the variables 'numcol' and 'prodval' through scatterplot, and
write your findings.
6. Plot and understand the relationship between categorical variable 'year' and a numerical variable
'prodvalue' through boxplot, and write your findings.
7. Visualize and understand the relationship between the multiple pairs of variables throughout different years
using pairplot and add your inferences. (use columns 'numcol', 'yield percol', 'total prod', 'prodvalue','year')
8. Display the correlation values using a plot and add your inferences. (use columns 'numcol', 'yield percol',
'total prod', 'stocks', 'price per lb', 'prodvalue').
